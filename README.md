## Overview

My goal, be it feasible or fantasy, is to write a chess engine from scratch. This bitboard is the 
first step. So, here we go! 

Using the command line interface (CLI) we can interact with the bitboard to move pieces 
and to display the state of the board. Currently, there are no rules. Any piece can be moved to any square at any time. 
Capital letters stand for white pieces, lower case stand for black pieces.

```angular2html
$ ./bitboard 
mv e2 e4
Moving e2 to e4
